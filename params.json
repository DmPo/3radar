  "body": "### Welcome to 3radar.org\r\n3radar.org is a nongovernmental initiative to develop a civil society platform and service for 3rd sector organizations, initiatives and people.\r\n\r\n### Why another platform\r\nThere are plenty of nice platforms and services. Yet we believe that something better can be done. This belief is based of our experience of voter education and mobilization campaigning. We know what is needed to fight dictators nonviolently and successfully.\r\n\r\n### What do we do\r\nActually we are developing something more than just another web-site or social network. We are drafting [CivicOS.net](https://dmpo.github.io/CivicOS/) standard to help activists integrate their 3rd sector initiatives for democracy, development and the rule of law. This project is our playground to test it and make sure that our testers suffer more than users. If you are brave enough, you can test the pilot at <http://3radar.org>.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2014 Dmytro Potekhin (@DmPo) was captured by the Donetsk terrorists and had some time in their prison to conceptualize the campaign he had coordinated during Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and in 2016 he met Dmytro Matsiuk (@dmmat) and Serhiy Moskalchuk (@ytrrty) to found the 3radar.org pilot project of the CivicOS.net concept.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease feel free to contact us and/or just contribute your code at <https://github.com/DmPo/3radar>.",
