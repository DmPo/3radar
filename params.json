  "body": "### Welcome to 3radar.org\r\n3radar.org is a nongovernmental initiative to develop a civil society platform and service for 3rd sector organizations, initiatives and people.\r\n\r\n### Why another platform\r\nThere are plenty of nice platforms and services. Yet we think that a better solution can be found. This belief is based on our experience of voter education and mobilization campaigning. We know what is needed to fight dictators nonviolently and successfully. If you are brave enough to test new projects, visit <http://3radar.org>.\r\n\r\n### What we actually do\r\nActually we are developing something more than just another web-site or social network. We are drafting [CivicOS.net](https://dmpo.github.io/CivicOS/) standard to help activists better integrate their 3rd sector initiatives for democracy, development and the rule of law. This project is our playground to test the standard and make sure that our testers suffer more than users. ;)\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nThe project became possible due to the competition it won at the [Stanford University Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law](http://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/) in 2016. In 2014 Dmytro Potekhin (@DmPo) was captured by the Donetsk terrorists and had some time in their prison to conceptualize the campaign he had coordinated during Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and in 2016 he met Dmytro Matsiuk (@dmmat) and Serhiy Moskalchuk (@ytrrty) to found the 3radar.org pilot project of the CivicOS.net concept. Andriy Savdeyev is working on the project's graphic design. \r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nWe are immensely grateful to Michael McFaul, Francis Fukuyama, Larry Dimond, Sarina Beges-Thysen, Sadaf Minapara, Darko Brkan, Jovan Jovanovich, Eugenia Kuznetsova, Phil Archer, Dan Brickley Andriy Horbal, Danylo Kubai, Serhiy Vasylchenko, Kateryna Okhrimenko, Gennadiy Kanishchenko, Natalka Zubar, Marko Suprun, Nazar Grynyk, Alex Pavlenko, Anatoliy Bondarenko, Alex Shevelo, Taras Tymchuk, Michael Voitovich, Oleg Lymarchuk, Olga Kornushyna and Taras Galkovskyi for their kind support of the idea.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease feel free to contact the team lead at @DmPo and contribute your code at <https://github.com/DmPo/3radar>.",
